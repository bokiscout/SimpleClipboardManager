# SinpleClipboardMangaer
Simple Clipboard Manger for Microsoft Windows

#### What is the idea behind this software
The idea is to mimic well known features found on Linux operating system that can store recent copied items in a easy accessible list.

#### What curent version can offer:
- Custom settings for:
- Number of items to be stored (remembered)
- Choise to store only text
- Choise to store only documents (directories, images...)
- Choise to store both images and documents
- Keep clipboard history for next boot
- Dont keep clipboard history for next boot.

#### Note:
Multiple documents copied at once are excluded from clipboard history.
This is not a bug, it is programera choise but can be changed if desired.
